      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      1
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    20 out of     600    3%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   1,200    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           53
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            18 out of      53   33%

    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          35 out of      53   66%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              20 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
