Various FPGA projects created using the Xilinx ISE 14.7 design tool and designed for the Papilio Pro Spartan 6 based development board.

Note that these are projects created as a learning exercise, specifically learning Verilog and FPGA program design so some of the earlier projects are less polished than the later ones. 

All of the projects have been included in the same Git repo as there are many independencies between them, which is typical of an FPGA design where a system is built from several modules (FPGA implementation doesn't have the luxury of a dependddncy management and artifactory like Maven. One day though....
